Answer: b
8. If a simple graph G, contains n vertices and m edges, the number of edges in the Graph G'(Complement of G) is ___________
a) (n*n-n-2*m)/2
b) (n*n+n+2*m)/2
c) (n*n-n-2*m)/2
d) (n*n-n+2*m)/2
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: The union of G and G’ would be a complete graph so, the number of edges in G’= number of edges in the complete form of G(nC2)-edges in G(m).
9. Which of the following properties does a simple graph not hold?
a) Must be connected
b) Must be unweighted
c) Must have no loops or multiple edges
d) Must have no multiple edges
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: A simple graph maybe connected or disconnected.
10. What is the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph having 10 vertices?
a) 24
b) 21
c) 25
d) 16
View Answer

Answer: c
Explanation: Let one set have n vertices another set would contain 10-n vertices.
Total number of edges would be n*(10-n), differentiating with respect to n, would yield the answer.
11. Which of the following is true?
a) A graph may contain no edges and many vertices
b) A graph may contain many edges and no vertices
c) A graph may contain no edges and no vertices
d) A graph may contain no vertices and many edges
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: A graph must contain at least one vertex.
12. For a given graph G having v vertices and e edges which is connected and has no cycles, which of the following statements is true?
a) v=e
b) v = e+1
c) v + 1 = e
d) v = e-1
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: For any connected graph with no cycles the equation holds true.
13. For which of the following combinations of the degrees of vertices would the connected graph be eulerian?
a) 1,2,3
b) 2,3,4
c) 2,4,5
d) 1,3,5
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: A graph is eulerian if either all of its vertices are even or if only two of its vertices are odd.
14. A graph with all vertices having equal degree is known as a __________
a) Multi Graph
b) Regular Graph
c) Simple Graph
d) Complete Graph
View Answer

Answer: b
